<h1>Tutorial: Using the Drag-and-Drop Code Translator</h1>
  <p>This tutorial will guide you through using the drag-and-drop code translator to create line code for a robotics kit. Follow these steps to drag code blocks, drop them in sequence, and see the translated output.</p>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 1: Click on the Code Translator</h3>
    <p>Click the website on your computer or tablet. You will see three columns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Code Blocks:</strong> The left column where you can see draggable blocks that represent different commands for your robot.</li>
      <li><strong>Drop Area:</strong> The middle column where you can drag the blocks to build a sequence of actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Translated Code:</strong> The right column where the dropped blocks will be translated into line coding instructions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 2: Drag a Block</h3>
    <p>Start by clicking on a block from the <strong>Code Blocks</strong> column. Hold the mouse button down and drag it towards the <strong>Drop Area</strong> column.</p>
    <!-- <p><em>Example Screenshot:</em></p>

  <!-- Step 3 -->
  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 3: Drop the Block</h3>
    <p>Once you have dragged a block over to the <strong>Drop Area</strong>, release the mouse button to drop it in place. Youâ€™ll see the block appear in the sequence you are building.</p>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 4: Translated Code</h3>
    <p>The translated code of line coding will appear in the <strong>Code Preview</strong> column. This is a representation of the blocks of code that you made in line coding.</p>
